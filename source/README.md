Please put all of the source files in here.

Have implemented a nice menu in main.cpp

Compile using the makefile and run using ./a.out
eg.
	make
	./a.out

Then use the arrow keys to make a selection and press enter to lock in your choice.

Need a player/character class with methods to move up, down, left, and right.
Looking like it may be a top down game for simplicity :)

Also I have tried to make the comments a little better for the ncurses stuff so that you may follow the code
a little better :))
